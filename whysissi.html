							<h2>A multifaceted figure</h2>
							<p>A lot has been said about the empress Elizabeth of Austria and everyone remembers her for her endearing yet infamous nickname. Sissi has been the protagonist of many books, movies and cartoons, usually portrayed as the <b>stereotypical</b> beautiful princess out of a fairy tale. We choose her because we wanted to build a heterogeneous narration of this character, trying to understand her in a large ranging prospective. In fact, she is still to this day a very mysterious figure and, contrary to the popular belief, she has been addressed many times as a <a style="text-decoration: none" href="https://books.google.it/books/about/The_Reluctant_Empress.html?id=WLFnAAAAMAAJ&redir_esc=y"><b>“reluctant princess”</b></a>.  Such as many other women in the same historical role, she always questioned the conventions of dynasty and court, giving priority to her personal interests. Elisabeth’s marriage with Fraz Joseph I led her to become <b>Queen of Hungary</b>, and over time she developed a deep affection for this country and its culture, frequently visiting Hungary as she truly enjoyed its more relaxed atmosphere and the beloved Hungarians. More importantly, she played a crucial role in the history of Europe, helping the realization of the <b>Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867</b>, by advocating for Hungary and the rights of its people. </p>

							<h2>European spirit</h2>
							<p>Empress Elisabeth (also known as Sissi 1837 – 1898) was one of the most famous royal women in European history. Celebrated for her great beauty and for her unique style, she was also one of the diplomats who oversaw the unification of Austria and Hungary, becoming a real heroine for the Hungarian people. She is still remembered today for her non conformist lifestyle, which has granted her the status of a modern feminism's precursor, and for the unfortunate events of her life.</p>

							<h2>Her legacy</h2>
							<p>Sissi’s legacy has lived on in books, films, and through memorials to her all throughout Austria. She is often remembered for her incredible beauty, style and energy. In 1955 the first of three movies called Sissi was released, starring Romy Schneider as Sissi. These movies saw an instant recognition and success, and are today still beloved in Austria and all throughout the world. Those movies also made Romy Schneider an instant star. In 2014, the annual Chanel Métiers d’Art collection was showcased in Salzburg. Designer Karl Lagerfeld made a short film featuring Cara Delevigne and Pharrell Williams as the imperial couple. Cara was wearing Sissi’s infamous white gown with stars in her hair and Pharrell was dressed as the emperor. Today, her name is often synonymous for glamour and designers will mention her whenever they want to evoke opulence.</p>
